When you cast a spell with Echo, resolve that Cast effect twice. Any additional effects granted for casting the spell are added to both resolutions of the spell. For example, you cast a spell with Echo that has a Cast effect of "Deal 2 damage". That spell was prepped to a breach that has the following two effects: "Deals +1 damage" and "Gravehold gains 1 life". You will resolve the following: "Deal 3 damage. Gravehold gains 1 life" then "Deal 3 damage. Gravehold gains 1 life". Additionally, both instances of damage may be directed to different targets.
