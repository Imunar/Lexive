Every mage (with the exception of the starting mages in Legacy) possesses an ability written on their mat, with space for 4 to 6 charge tokens under it. During any player's main phase, that player may spend 2$ to gain a charge. They cannot choose to pay aether to give charges to their allies. When a player gains a charge, they take a charge token and place it on their player mat, beneath the ability description. No player may have more charges than their ability requires (4, 5, or 6). When a player has all of their charges, they may use their ability at the appropriate time -- the phase in which it can be used is written just below the ability name; this is typically during that same player's main phase. When using their ability, the mage first loses all of their charges, and then resolves the effect.
