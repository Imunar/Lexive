Power cards are one of three types of nemesis cards. All power cards have "POWER: N" on them. When a power card enters play, place N power tokens on it. If it has an "IMMEDIATELY:" effect, resolve that now. Unless discarded, power cards stay in play for N nemesis turns before resolving. During the nemesis main phase, remove 1 power token from each power card in play, from oldest to newest. When a power card has no power tokens left, resolve its effect and then discard it. Only resolve a power card's "POWER: N" effect when the last power token is removed. Some power cards also have a "TO DISCARD:" text on them. This represents something that must be done (typically spending aether) during any player's main phase to discard the power card. When resolving a "TO DISCARD:" effect, the player must fully resolve the entire effect. If a power card is discarded this way, its effect is not resolved.
