When a nemesis card forces a player to degrade a card, that player must first destroy a card that costs 2$ or more. Then, that player MAY gain a card of the same type from any supply pile which costs less than the cost of the destroyed card and place it into their hand. If a player cannot degrade a card, that player suffers 2 damage.
