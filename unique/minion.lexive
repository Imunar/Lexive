Minions are one of three types of nemesis cards. When a minion is drawn, it is put into play with their starting life. If a minion has a number of shield tokens on its card, it gains that many shield tokens. When a minion enters play, immediately resolve its "IMMEDIATELY:" effect, if applicable. Do not resolve its "PERSISTENT:" effect this turn. When the nemesis takes its turn, resolve each minion's "PERSISTENT:" effect in order from oldest to newest. When the life of a minion reaches 0, it is immediatedly discarded.
