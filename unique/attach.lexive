Some relics allow you to Attach them to a breach. When you attach a relic to a breach, place that relic underneath that breach token. You cannot attach a relic to a breach that already has a relic attached to it. Attached relics are not discarded at the end of the turn. If an attached relic is discarded, it is placed in the discard pile of the player whose breach it was attached to. If a breach with a relic attached to it is destroyed, the attached relic is discarded. If an effect does not otherwise allow for it, you may not choose to discard an attached relic (for example to make room for a better-suited relic).
