Outcasts introduces the Curse deck. This is a deck of cards that is placed faceup near the nemesis deck. Cards in the nemesis deck may refer to cards in the Curse deck. When a player is told to gain a card from the Curse deck, they search for that specific card and then gain it. The Curse deck is not a supply pile. When a card from the Curse deck is destroyed, do not return it to the Curse deck.
