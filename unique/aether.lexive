Aether ($) can be gained during a player's turn by playing gems, relics, by casting spells, or by using their or another player's ability, if applicable. Aether may be gained even if it is not spent. Any aether gained on a turn that is not spent is lost. Aether does not accumulate over turns, nor can it be given to other players.
