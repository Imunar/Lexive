But of all The Nameless, the Queen has brought the most ruin upon Gravehold, for her armies are vast and lethal, more clockwork things than beasts.#There is a saying about the husks: ""To kill one is to breed six"". Only when the Queen retreats through the void do they relent, left to twitch and expire on the cave floor among the bodies of those they have overcome. After each siege, weeks are spent shoveling up the metallic scraps, which are carried deep into the bowels of the caves. There they are heaped in formless piles, their countenances unchanged in death beyong their stillness and dim eyes.";HUSK TRACK#When Carapace Queen Swarms, count the number of husks in play and resolve the following:##0-3 husks:           [ ] [ ] [ ]#  Place four husks#  into play.#4-6 husks:           [ ] [ ] [ ]#  Any player#  discards a#  prepped spell.#  Place two husks#  into play.#7-10 husks:          [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]#  Gravehold suffers#  5 damage.#11-12 husks:         [ ] [ ]#  The player with#  the lowest life#  suffers 3 damage.#  Discard a husk.#13+ husks:           [ ] [ ] [ ]#  The players lose.;Aeon's End;;226,227,228,229,230,231,232,233,234

If this is true, then the Crooked Mask's domain is that of corruption, for the weapon he wields is brought by temptation.#How do we slay a god, especially one with such a dark influence over the weaker survivors among us? When we have endured on so little for so long, how do we hold back when what we need most seems to be offered so freely?#Many in Gravehold murmur that behind its grim visage lies a cruel and desolate grin.

First our world was taken, forcing the few that then survived into the black cold of the earth. For aeons, generations of survivors eked out meager lives in Gravehold, the breach mages all the while honing their fell craft. For aeons, The Nameless would lay siege to the city, bringing us ever closer to extinction. But their cruelest stroke was in erasing our very history.#The Prince of Gluttons was the fourth of their kind to besiege the city. Even at the time, it seemed too easy to repel his attack and send The Prince lumbering back into the bright nothing of the breach. But soon those that survived the attack had forgotten the name of The World That Was. Wives stared into the empty eyes of their husbands and children with no memory of their love for one another. The old ways were lost, the words of The First Tribe mere symbols scratched upon scrolls, all of it devoured, obliterated from eternity. The Prince feeds on our very histories, leaving behind only our fear and doubt. We are a people with no past nor future, trapped only in the fleeting moments before our eyes.;;Aeon's End;;255,256,257,258,259,260,261,262,263

Our children learn to hold a blade soon after their first words are uttered. With each generation, the joy in their faces and voices diminishes, every instinct sharpened to a single word: survive.#Malastar believes The Nameless waited for us to become worthy foes before sending their champion, the one we call ""Rageborne"". It is their executioner; here to quicken Gravehold's end. Never have I seen such anger, all of it reflected into the dead eyes of the rabid beasts it commands.#When the breaches open, the beggars in Chasmwalk shout above the city bells: ""The end is near! The end is near!"" And in my hollow heart, I know the truth of it. The end was here since first The Nameless came.

Draw a card from the trogg deck and place it into play.;Shuffle all of the trogg cards together and place them facedown to form the trogg deck. Draw a card from the trogg deck and place it into play.;;;All troggs have three life instead of two life.;- There are three types of troggs in the trogg deck: Orps, Yuds, and Zoms.#- When a trogg enters play, resolve the effect on that card equal to the number of troggs in play of that trogg's type. The first trogg has no effect.#- When a trogg is discarded, place it in the trogg discard pile. (This is not the same as the nemesis discard pile.);In the ancient time, before our kind, the troggs walked The World That Was. From what the elders remember of the lost tales, there were three great tribes, each with a purpose. The Yud were keepers of life, gifted in the art of creation, molders of flesh. The Orp were beings of shadow, masters of ruination and death, the counterweights on the scales of life, against which the Yud were balanced. And the Zom were neither light nor dark, but instead were dreamers with great minds.#The world was unforgiving and empty then, but malleable, a great marble to be chiseled and shaped as they saw fit. And though the tribes were each different, they lived in great harmony. The world flourished and faded, developed and dreamed, muc the way worlds are suppposed to. Eventually the world they wove was complete and no longer needed them, so they journeyed into the black of this very cave, to this very city, to sleep and be forgotten.#Now The Crone has stirred the troggs from their slumber. Awakened with new and malicious purpose, they issue from the infinite depths of the cave in their hordes, eager to take back their ancient city and undo their own great feats. And who are we but immigrants here in Gravehold, in this world they made for us? Are we not their children in some measure? Is it not their right to take it all away?;;The Depths;;46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,59,63

Gravehold collapses into rubble and the players lose.;"""It is a strange thing to say we have never seen The Nameless die, but we have indeed witnessed one being born.#The Umbra titan speared from the feigned carcass of the Thrice-Dead Prophet like some foul offspring. At first we thought it merely some grotesque machination, another minion perhaps, but in time it has proven to be an adversary of equal measure. Even the indigenous beasts of the cave seem to worship it.#Beneath the skin of the cave it roars, burrowing through rock and darkness like a blind knife through muscle. The ground shakes as a precursor to its attack. It is a horrible thing to see people not know where to seek shelter; instead inert as they wait for the monstrous thing to emerge -- if it emerges at all.#Of all The Nameless, the Titan is the most feral. Xaxos think them holy, but this is no god or otherwise. It is an animal of the basest instincts: to hint, to kill, to live."" - Indira, Breach Apprentice";;War Eternal;;266,267,268,269,270,271,272,273,274

When we disrupted his ritual and defeated the spider-like Nameless he'd fused himself with, we recovered the scattered remains of his journal. From the notes we could piece together, it looks like this poor creature used to be a simple rabbit before Arachnos accidentally abandoned it inside the Void. Now look what it has become. If this is what a few months of exposure to the Void essence can do to an animal, it's no wonder Xaxos and his ilk believe the Void is supremely powerful. But all I have seen it do is twist, corrupt, and blacken. Can such a force ever truly be used for good? That remains to be seen.

The harbor towns of M'hlark were next to fall; the warm waters lapping against the jagged; frozen shapes of those caught unaware. Even the very earth below its shadow became glass; left to shatter into crude and useless shapes.#The elder of the First Tribe bade his people to pay it tribute; for in his ignorance he considered it a divine messenger from the gods they worshipped then.
