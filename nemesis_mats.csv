Our children learn to hold a blade soon after their first words are uttered. With each generation, the joy in their faces and voices diminishes, every instinct sharpened to a single word: survive.#Malastar believes The Nameless waited for us to become worthy foes before sending their champion, the one we call ""Rageborne"". It is their executioner; here to quicken Gravehold's end. Never have I seen such anger, all of it reflected into the dead eyes of the rabid beasts it commands.#When the breaches open, the beggars in Chasmwalk shout above the city bells: ""The end is near! The end is near!"" And in my hollow heart, I know the truth of it. The end was here since first The Nameless came. We only have prolonged it.";;1;Aeon's End;;262;276

Only when the Queen retreats through the void do they relent, left to twitch and expire on the cave floor among the bodies of those they have overcome. After each siege, weeks are spent shoveling up the metallic scraps, which are carried deep into the bowels of the caves. There they are heaped in formless piles, their countenances unchanged in death beyong their stillness and dim eyes.";HUSK TRACK#When Carapace Queen Swarms, count the number of husks in play and resolve the following:##0-3 husks:          [ ] [ ] [ ]#  Place four husks#  into play.#4-6 husks:          [ ] [ ] [ ]#  Any player#  discards a#  prepped spell.#  Place two husks#  into play.#7-10 husks:         [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]#  Gravehold suffers#  5 damage.#11-12 husks:        [ ] [ ]#  The player with#  the lowest life#  suffers 3 damage.#  Discard a husk.#13+ husks:          [ ] [ ] [ ]#  The players lose.;1;Aeon's End;;226;234
