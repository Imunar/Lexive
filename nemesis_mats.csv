Our children learn to hold a blade soon after their first words are uttered. With each generation, the joy in their faces and voices diminishes, every instinct sharpened to a single word: survive.#Malastar believes The Nameless waited for us to become worthy foes before sending their champion, the one we call ""Rageborne"". It is their executioner; here to quicken Gravehold's end. Never have I seen such anger, all of it reflected into the dead eyes of the rabid beasts it commands.#When the breaches open, the beggars in Chasmwalk shout above the city bells: ""The end is near! The end is near!"" And in my hollow heart, I know the truth of it. The end was here since first The Nameless came. We only have prolonged it.";;1;Aeon's End;;262,263,264,265,266,267,268,269,270,271,272,273,274,275,276

But of all The Nameless, the Queen has brought the most ruin upon Gravehold, for her armies are vast and lethal, more clockwork things than beasts.#There is a saying about the husks: ""To kill one is to breed six"". Only when the Queen retreats through the void do they relent, left to twitch and expire on the cave floor among the bodies of those they have overcome. After each siege, weeks are spent shoveling up the metallic scraps, which are carried deep into the bowels of the caves. There they are heaped in formless piles, their countenances unchanged in death beyong their stillness and dim eyes.";HUSK TRACK#When Carapace Queen Swarms, count the number of husks in play and resolve the following:##0-3 husks:           [ ] [ ] [ ]#  Place four husks#  into play.#4-6 husks:           [ ] [ ] [ ]#  Any player#  discards a#  prepped spell.#  Place two husks#  into play.#7-10 husks:          [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]#  Gravehold suffers#  5 damage.#11-12 husks:         [ ] [ ]#  The player with#  the lowest life#  suffers 3 damage.#  Discard a husk.#13+ husks:           [ ] [ ] [ ]#  The players lose.;1;Aeon's End;;226,227,228,229,230,231,232,233,234
Umbra Titan;70;3;1;If there is one nemesis turn order card in the turn order discard pile, any player suffers 2 damage.

Gravehold collapses into rubble and the players lose.;"""It is a strange thing to say we have never seen The Nameless die, but we have indeed witnessed one being born.#The Umbra titan speared from the feigned carcass of the Thrice-Dead Prophet like some foul offspring. At first we thought it merely some grotesque machination, another minion perhaps, but in time it has proven to be an adversary of equal measure. Even the indigenous beasts of the cave seem to worship it.#Beneath the skin of the cave it roars, burrowing through rock and darkness like a blind knife through muscle. The ground shakes as a precursor to its attack. It is a horrible thing to see people not know where to seek shelter; instead inert as they wait for the monstrous thing to emerge -- if it emerges at all.#Of all The Nameless, the Titan is the most feral. Xaxos think them holy, but this is no god or otherwise. It is an animal of the basest instincts: to hint, to kill, to live."" - Indira, Breach Apprentice";;2;War Eternal;;266,267,268,269,270,271,272,273,274
Experiment 153;0;3;1;Move any maw token two spaces forward toward the end of its track.;Place the Growth Mat next to this mat. Place the four maw tokens on the four starting spaces on the Growth Mat. Move two different maw tokens one space forward. Experiment 153 does not use the nemesis life dial. Instead, give each maw 20 life.;;After resolving the Unleash, move any maw token one space forward toward the end of its track.;;When you move a maw token forward onto a space with an effect, resolve that effect.#If a maw token starts to move forward any number of spaces while it's at the end of its track, instead resolve the effect of the space that it's currently on.#When a player would deal damage to Experiment 153, that player deals all of that damage to a single maw instead.#When a player deals 3 or more damage with one instance to a maw, move that maw token back one space.#When a maw token is on the first or fourth space of its track, it cannot be moved back.#When a maw is reduced to 0 life, discard that token and move another maw token back two spaces.#The players win when the Growth Mat has no maw token on it.;"""I had naively assumed that after we defeated Fenrix, we would be free of Arachnos's twisted creations. When we disrupted his ritual and defeated the spider-like Nameless he'd fused himself with, we recovered the scattered remains of his journal. From the notes we could piece together, it looks like this poor creature used to be a simple rabbit before Arachnos accidentally abandoned it inside the Void. Now look what it has become. If this is what a few months of exposure to the Void essence can do to an animal, it's no wonder Xaxos and his ilk believe the Void is supremely powerful. But all I have seen it do is twist, corrupt, and blacken. Can such a force ever truly be used for good? That remains to be seen. For now, we must do our best to bring peace to this pitiful, tormented soul."" - Taqren";Growth Mat#[S1] <> [ ] <> [ ] > [G:2,P:2] <> [ ] <> [ ] <> [ ] <> [P:4,G:3]#[S2] <> [ ] <> [ ] > [  G:4  ] <> [ ] <> [ ] <> [ ] <> [  G:7  ]#[S3] <> [ ] <> [ ] > [  P:4  ] <> [ ] <> [ ] <> [ ] <> [  P:6  ]#[S4] <> [ ] <> [ ] > [  D:4  ] <> [ ] <> [ ] <> [ ] <> [  D:8  ]##G:N = Gravehold suffers N damage.#P:N = Any player suffers N damage.#D:N = The players collectively discard N cards.;5;Outcasts;1c;6,8,11,12,14,16,22,23,24
