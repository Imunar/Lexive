Adelheim;Breach Mage Weaponsmith;4;Aethereal Ward;5;N;;When a nemesis attack or power card is drawn but before it is resolved, you may discard it. It has no effect.#(The nemesis does not draw a replacement card);;0,2,4,3;1,C,C,S,S;C,C,C,C,C;;;;;It is folly what I do, to make things in a place where everything is broken. But still, I bring my hammer down. We all have work to do and I'll not let pride keep me from it.#Ours is an army of fools, yes. We make weapons of the very breaches they wander through. No mystery we die so, when we try to play with the deadliest powers we know. But what of it truly? This is still the way of the things, in spite of all that has passed: some people die while the rest must fight. So I bring my hammer down, again and again. Mending swords. Fashioning strangeness from breach-touched ore. They ask it of me and thus it is done, for folly or not.;Aeon's End
Brama;Breach Mage Elder;1;Brink Siphon;5;M;;Any player gains 4 life.;;0,3,4,2;2,C,C,C,C;C,C,C,S,S;;;;;My conclave of sisters is long ago gone, all of them ash in the world above. I do not remember their names, only their faces and the brightness in their eyes. Their songs fade in the gray shadows of my many years, and I alone can still hear them. Only Gravehold is more ancient than I. Yet somehow I endure.#This city looks to me for guidance, for I have walked a long, wearisome path to stand before them. This is my duty, my burden, my privilege. It was I who counseled them to collapse the mouth of the cave, to entomb us here. It was I who taught the mages to wield the sister-words. Where so many have slipped beneath the shadow, I have remained in light.#Many say we are lost, that Gravehold is just that: our grave. They say that, like my sisters, we will be erased, our bones left to molder in the silence of this cave. But glory will be ours again and I will live to feel the sun and wind on my face once more. Faith, younglings. It is our best weapon.;Aeon's End
Kadir;Breach Mage Delver;3;Otherworldly Gate;5;P;;That player may return up to three spells in their discard pile to their hand. That player may prep up to two spells to each of their opened breaches this turn.;;0,2,3,2;3,C,C,C,S;C,C,C,S,S;;;;;I am alone in my hunger to explore the deeps. The elders the ancient tribes once worshipped a sleeping god somewhere in the maze of tunnels and vaults below. I have journeyed farther than any other and seen many an oddity in the pure black silence. but none yet that resembles a god, asleep or otherwise.#There is no peace to be had elsewhere in Gravhold. Woe fills the air like dust, a patina of dread scattered upon everything. But in the deep, ah, in the deep there is peace. In the deep, there is wisdom that wells up from within as your self dissolves into the emptiness. This is why we take the youngling mages there, to decant their minds, to clear their thoughts, even if only for that single pilgrimage. But I believe our true salvation lies beneath the city. Somewhere in the shadows is a place that even The Nameless cannot find. One day I will lead them to it, and they too will know peace.;Aeon's End
Xaxos (AE);Breach Mage Adept;4;Metaphysical Link;5;P;;Allies collectively gain 4 charges. Reveal the turn order deck and return the revealed cards in any order.;;0,4,4,3;4,C,C,C,C;C,C,C,C,S;;;;;The others, they do not understand. For them, struggle i a virtue acknowledged by less cruel gods than these. They ignore the dark around them and seek a world whose name they cannot remember. But I have discerned our road to salvation, fractured and perilous, straight through the heart of the void.#We may learn much from these creatures, these divinities, though dark they may be. Theirs is a power to cull wounds, to tear wide the membrane of the universe, to traverse the very emptiness that lay between. Is it not within reason to presume they also have some means to shape worlds as well as destroy them? Perhaps they can whisper into existence more than their fell armies and beasts. The tools they wield are just that - tools. Who is to say we cannot use a tool for a better end?#Yet these words alone are enough to brand a mage heretic. It is for this reason I stifle them, though these thoughts echo behind my silence in a way that seams wisdom. For now, I will study our foes closely, and in doing so I shall learn how to lift us from this torment... no matter what means I must use.;Aeon's End
Mist (AE);Breach Mage Dagger Captain;2;Divine Augury;5;M;;Any ally draws four cards.;;0,2,3,3;5,C,C,C,S;C,C,C,S,S;;;;;The mages, they all think me brace, their closest substitute to Thraxir. His death was like all the others: swift and cruel. It is true, I have waded in the fire of the breach three times. Each time I have left splinters of myself behind, little shreds ripped from my bleeding soul. Though many beasts have been quieted by my blade, I must confess each one of them has scared me more than the last.#I am not brave. Not like Thraxir, not like Brama. I simply do this because it was asked of me. I fight not truly for Gravehold alone, but selfishly - I would risk everything for the hope of leaving this place. I was made a dagger captain and taught the sister-words to wield the breach, but I am no different than any one here: scared, desperate, and willing to die for an opportunity to once again be alive.;Aeon's End
Jian;Breach Mage Orphan;2;Black Mirror;4;M;;Cast any player's prepped spell without discarding it. Then cast that prepped spell again. (Discard it afterward.);;0,0,4,3;6,C,C,S,S;C,C,C,S,S;;;;;Father died. The orb. I took it in my hands. And then quiet was upon me.#Orphan. Then the mages. I learned the sister-words. The spark. But never spoke them.#Like Phaedraxa, I see. It changed me.#There are many worlds. The Nameless are a scourge to all. So, war.#Once, I was born. Soon, I will save them, then become nothing. Everything in between is just waiting.#A web. It's all a web.;Aeon's End
Lash;Breach Mage Scout;6;Quicken Thought;5;P;;Shuffle any player's turn order card into the turn order deck. That player suffers 1 damage. (You may not choose the wildcard turn order card.);;0,2,4,2;7,C,C,C,S;C,C,C,S,S;;;;;"Like the jagged rocks around us, these are hard times. You can see it reflected in the eyes of even the heartiest folk: the fog of constant dread looming large within them.#But me, I laugh, I smile. For any day is worth living well, no? What other use would it be? We are the lucky ones, though our journey may be paved with strife. I say laugh anyway. Smile anyway. Let my voice be heard ringing against the wall of the cave, echoing into nothing. If today be my last, then let it also be my best.#Often I stare down at the city from the balustrade, the dirt market being my favorite place to contemplate. The good people there, peddling their wares, the cacophony of their haggling, the scent of salted meat and brine. And I think to myself, ""The world does go on."" And so it does, in spite of our trials, our great adversity. The people in the market, they still find it within themselves to sit at their stall and hope for a good day's profit. To savor the banter of a spirited haggle. To cook a simple yet tasty meal to share with loved ones. And at night in their hovels, they dream against the dark. There is no beauty in this world or any other greater than that.";Aeon's End
Phaedraxa;Breach Mage Seer;6;Auspex Rune;5;T;;Prevent any damage that the players or Gravehold would suffer during that turn.;;9,0,3,2;8,C,C,C,S;C,C,C,C,S;;;;;Time is a web, like the ones the howling spinners weave in the deeps. Each strand reaches backward and forward at once. What was, what is, what will be, there is no difference in the web. Silk is silk. Time is time.#I spoke the sister-words before they were taught to me, before I could walk, but after the world was gone. Brama says that is because the wraiths of the sisters encircle me beyond the veil, but she understands not. There is no host of sister-ghosts guiding my path. There is no chorus of voices within me, only my own. I merely see the web and all trapped in it.#I look at the survivors of this city, this beautiful and stark place hidden in the deep shadows. And in the web, I behold Gravehold, as it was and as it will be. I peel aside the door of a breach. And in the web, a breach widens, much like an eye struggling against the dark. I am born and I die. The Nameless are much the same.#Time is a web, no different, no more.;Aeon's End
Nym;Breach Mage Apprentice;7;Terminus Barrier;5;M;;Discard the top card of the nemesis deck. If you discarded an attack card, discard an additional card.;;0,4,3,3;1,C,C,C,C;C,C,C,S,S;;;;;The Nameless... what a stupid name for these things. It makes no sense. It's just frightened people trying to understand something they don't. Monsters. That's what these things are. Nothing more, nothing less.#Malastar says respecting one's foe is the straightest and clearest path to defeating them. But why would I respect monsters? Malastar is wrong. Respect is a useless concept in this fight - I have no respect for those freaks and I have turned as many of them to cinder as anyone.#A lot of people are of 'The Nameless', but not me. They think I am too young to know what fear is, but really, fear is the only thing we younglings know. But I choose not to fear them any more. I won't give them anything other than my fire.;The Depths
Z'hana (AE);Breach Mage Renegade;4;Sanctum Glyph;6;M;;Gravehold gains 7 life.;;9,4,3,2;2,C,C,C,C;C,C,C,C,S;;;;;Through the flames I could hear them calling for me. My mother, my father. Their voices drowned in fire and smoke... That was the day I lost my family. That was the day I discovered I was a mage.#My philosophies on The Nameless are even less popular than Xaxos's. Many times I have slept in the crypts for things I have said to others. But many more nights I have fought back the dark, side by side with those who have locked the crypt door behind me.#I have journeyed to the cave mouth many times, sitting in the weak light that somehow manages to penetrate the mountain of rubble that bars our way back to The World That Was. Each time I go, I remove a stone. If they catch me, the crypts await. But I always go back, removing another stone and yet another. One day I will seek whatever awaits me beyond this place. One day I will remove the last stone.;The Depths
Reeve;Breach Mage Elite;4;Quelling Blade;4;M;;Deal 5 damage to a minion. Deal 3 damage to a different minion.;;0,2,3,2;3,C,C,S,S;C,C,C,S,S;;;;;I lost the arm to tainted jade. I felt it creeping through my arteries and lopped it off without a thought. Best to lose the arm and keep the rest, no?#Kadir says I was born for this, meant to live here and now in this damnable hole in the ground to fight these things. And she has the right of it. This is who I am, what I am: a blunt instrument to be used against monsters. My life matters not for much more than that. And I am at peace with it.#Whenever those bells ring I feel my heart swell as I heave my chopper from its sheath. I smell the air burn as the breach opens and I cannot run there fast enough. We all have a purpose, a gift to give. This is mine.;The Depths
Malastar;Breach Mage Mentor;4;Gift of Aether;6;M;;Gain a spell from any supply pile. You may prep that spell to any player's opened breach.;;9,4,1,3;1,C,C,C,C;C,C,C,C,C;;;;;You can always tell which younglings will be mages. Mostly, they are girls, but sometimes a boy-child will carry the spark, though weaker than their sister-kind. Training each of them is my sad calling, for mages come and go like the black days in this place.#First, they learn the sister-words, the mage's tongue, the language of all things. Next we fashion them a gem, one that is theirs alone, a conduit for their nascent power. After this, Kadir takes them deep within the bowels of the cave, where they must find their way back with only their gem to protect them. Many find their way home, but we have lost many would-be mages in my years.#A student's last task is to slay a beast, armed again only with their gem and their wits. The child is dropped down a shaft outside Chasmwalk, left alone with whatever miscreation we have snared from the void. Sometimes the creature is wounded, weak, but always they are hungry. A student that navigates this ordeal is named apprentice. After that, one need only survive long enough to earn the rank of mage.;The Nameless

Mist (WE);Voidwalker;5;Exalted Brand;6;M;;Cast up to three different spells prepped by any number of players. For each spell cast this way, place that spell into any ally's hand.;;0,2,3,3;1,C,C,C,S;C,C,C,S,S;;;;;"""I am the vessel now. I -- the 'I' I was, at least -- entered the breach, as I had done thrice before, as in my absurd and youthful eagerness to slay these creatures, I even desired to fight them where they lived. As if the beasts we fight would be intimidated to fight in the void.#Child that I was, some fortune was with me, as I was victorious. But as I turned to leave the breach, a much greater fortune awaited. I remember I was just about to step through, when I heard the sound. A humming, a ringing, yet more musical, as if a thousand crystal insects sang a chorus. In an instant, the sound surrounded me. In a second instant, the sound entered me.#The events that happened to the 'me' that was, those seem to me now at a remove. Old hurts, childhood loves, battle fears -- my memories of the time before the change are but memories of memories now. as if I remember a vivid story told to me rather than events in my own life.#But, oh, even so, I remember how much the sound hurt. It ate and burned, fire and acid. The sound grabbed my body and convulsed it from the inside, every mote of my being individually seized and shaken. If I had any control over my body, I would have fallen to the ground and screamed. But I could only burn.#I am sorry for what happen to the 'me' that was. I am sorry for the pain it caused her. But it was the only way to prepare her for my task.#I am the vessel now.""";War Eternal

If you are exhausted, any ally gains 5 life instead.;;0,3,4,3;2,C,C,S,S;C,C,C,S,S;;;;;"""I am a coward and cowards are not meant to fight wars. As cowards are wont to do, I ran when I saw the Umbra Titan heave from the feigned corpse of the Prophet, pushing fellow dirt merchants and even a child so that I might save my own life. When the Titan's shadow loomed over me, everything changed in an instant.#'Ulgimor'. This is the only word it says, not that anyone else can hear it. Thus I have taken to calling the creature this name, as have others. It is everything I am not, yet the breach mages insist it is, by extension, some part of me. They have taught it their ways, giving me some lump of enchanted coal to try and control the thing. As it frenzies in battle, I cower behind the shield Adelheim forged, waiting for it all to end.#But Ulgimor would never let this happen, for without me no shadow would be cast. I take what little comfort I can in this notion, though we both know the life of a coward suits me better than that of a hero.""";War Eternal
Quilius;Breach Mage Assassin;5;Quietus Vow;5;M;;Deal 2 damage for each Trophy token you have.#(You may not distribute this damage over multiple targets.);;0,0,4,3;C,C,C,3,S;C,C,C,4,S;;;;;"""One. Two. Three. Four. Five.#One. In the monastery cavern, when I was but a child. The morning I earned some of these scars. So far away, back in The World That Was. The monks found me first, bleeding and blasted. When they asked what had happened, I said only that I killed it. What else needed to be said? They didn't believe me until they found its body under the ruined wall. The monks started training me the very next day.#Two. At the end of my training. A test of my skills. The monks suggested a lesser being, but I wanted to bring back one of my own choosing, one that would move me further on the path. I dragged its head behind me for days before I found my way back. I graduated late, but with the highest distinction.#Three. I lay in wait for this one. It had to be this one, for the path, and this place was the only place where one of these beasts had ever been seen. I lay in wait a long time. By the end of the third year, I began to despair of its existence. My patience was rewarded. The greatest lesson an assassin learns is not how to kill. It's how to wait.#Four and five are yet to come. But I know they will come to me and offer themselves through combat. And I will kill them and move along the path. Each step brings me closer. Each kill brings me closer to the mind of the gods. Look into the eyes when you make a kill. You may get a glimpse of the creature's true master.""";War Eternal

If you have four opened breaches, any ally gains a card from any supply pile and places it on top of their deck.;;0,4,4,4;5,C,C,C,C;C,C,C,C,S;;;;;"""I still remember the day The Conclave sentenced me to sleep. You see, they did not believe in killing, as necessary a thing as it may seem to all other creatures and creeds. My crime, among others, was in questioning the nature of their ways. And thus the punishment was to entomb my mind in the gulag of my still body for eternity. They called this the 'Black Mausoleum'.#And so it was that I lay in the hollow of my sarcophagus, drawing what then I thought was the last conscious breath of my very long life. The light died all around me and with it I went, trapped in the amber of dreams.#I cannot recall my time in the sepulcher of sleep. Just blackness and quiet unending. But there came a day when the light spilled across my face and I gasped as a brutish man yanked me from my coma. All around us were tendrils of strange light spiraling into infinity, each one flecked with what seemed a world in miniature. I still remember plucking one of those dlicate lights from the nothing, unaware I had snuffed out an entire world.#In time our cadre of orphans grew in number and in strangeness. We lost many companions along the way, each erased like that tiny light in the spiral. Their faith gave me the strength to journey forward, though in my heart it was retribution that urged me on.#There was a day when the spiral seemed to fall away and a sudden cold was upon us. Garu's labored breath reverberated the dirt crunching under foot. And this was the first time I knew I was truly awake. This was the day we met Indira and learned the truth of it. And once again, I found myself entombed in the black quiet of another world.""";War Eternal
Dezmodia (WE);Voidborn Prodigy;3;Tempest Sigil;6;M;;Any player destroys an opened I or II breach and returns any spells prepped to that breach to their hand.

Yan Magda held me as I drew my very first breath and my true mother took her last. I still remember this, as though it only just happened. From that moment forth, I was her student.#Time in the void is not as it is elsewhere. It moves too quickly, and sometimes not at all. My years are not what they seem. I am not as I seem. I remember being born, and, somehow, what it feels like to die. Like The Nameless, I live in the place in between.#Brama and her sycophants, let them have Gravehold. Let them cower here in the dark. There will come a time when the void will swallow all. And I will stare into the infinite with warm tears in my eyes, knowing in some strange way I am home.""";War Eternal

Swords must be swords, spears must be spears, bows must shoot arrows. But a hammer can be a tool, can build as well as destroy. A hammer helps us remember we have something to protect, something beyond our fight.#Brama and I have had many long discussions about how appearances matter, and how they don't, and how to look inside them to the truth. I remind her of my training, when I chose my gem. Even she looked at me askance when I returned with a plain gray rock. Until I showed her the spell to look beyond the surface to the beautiful geode within.#Hidden power, hidden reasons, these suit our purposes best. Especially now, when we are surrounded by so many others with hidden thoughts. Neither I nor Brama can fully divine the mind of Yan Magda, nor the mind of the being we once called Mist. Both claim to be allies. Both have helped in the fight so far, that much must be admitted. Nevertheless, I will keep my greatest reasons, and my greatest powers, in reserve.

Though I laughed, the words cut deep. I see the way they look upon me, with doubt, with horror. In truth, I cannot remember being anything other than this.#I wandered the void, then ended up here. There is no more to my story. My life before is but an echo, a single familiar sound deep in the hollow of my heart. I hear a voice, a child's voice. And under the rasping of my breath, its wordless cries fill me with dread and longing. I can taste the name, but never enough to utter it aloud.#I knelt that day in the hovels, and forced a smile upon my face. 'The world is full of monsters, little one.

There is a wisdom in every stone, a truth in every shadow. The echoes of our own voices are but a mirror. And for this very reason, I have never, nor will ever, let my feet touch the hallowed earth below.#And though my brothers fade in the grim quiet above, their wisdom remains my compass.

Behind masks, we practice our blood magic and peer into the fractured barrier between our world and theirs. The dead air that spills from the breach carries whispers.
