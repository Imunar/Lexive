Adelheim;Breach Mage Weaponsmith;4;Aethereal Ward;5;N;;When a nemesis attack or power card is drawn but before it is resolved, you may discard it. It has no effect.#(The nemesis does not draw a replacement card);;0,2,4,3;1,C,C,S,S;C,C,C,C,C;;;;;It is folly what I do, to make things in a place where everything is broken. But still, I bring my hammer down. We all have work to do and I'll not let pride keep me from it.#Ours is an army of fools, yes. We make weapons of the very breaches they wander through. No mystery we die so, when we try to play with the deadliest powers we know. But what of it truly? This is still the way of the things, in spite of all that has passed: some people die while the rest must fight. So I bring my hammer down, again and again. Mending swords. Fashioning strangeness from breach-touched ore. They ask it of me and thus it is done, for folly or not.;Aeon's End
Brama;Breach Mage Elder;1;Brink Siphon;5;M;;Any player gains 4 life.;;0,3,4,2;2,C,C,C,C;C,C,C,S,S;;;;;My conclave of sisters is long ago gone, all of them ash in the world above. I do not remember their names, only their faces and the brightness in their eyes. Their songs fade in the gray shadows of my many years, and I alone can still hear them. Only Gravehold is more ancient than I. Yet somehow I endure.#This city looks to me for guidance, for I have walked a long, wearisome path to stand before them. This is my duty, my burden, my privilege. It was I who counseled them to collapse the mouth of the cave, to entomb us here. It was I who taught the mages to wield the sister-words. Where so many have slipped beneath the shadow, I have remained in light.#Many say we are lost, that Gravehold is just that: our grave. They say that, like my sisters, we will be erased, our bones left to molder in the silence of this cave. But glory will be ours again and I will live to feel the sun and wind on my face once more. Faith, younglings. It is our best weapon.;Aeon's End
Kadir;Breach Mage Delver;3;Otherworldly Gate;5;P;;That player may return up to three spells in their discard pile to their hand. That player may prep up to two spells to each of their opened breaches this turn.;;0,2,3,2;3,C,C,C,S;C,C,C,S,S;;;;;I am alone in my hunger to explore the deeps. The elders the ancient tribes once worshipped a sleeping god somewhere in the maze of tunnels and vaults below. I have journeyed farther than any other and seen many an oddity in the pure black silence. but none yet that resembles a god, asleep or otherwise.#There is no peace to be had elsewhere in Gravhold. Woe fills the air like dust, a patina of dread scattered upon everything. But in the deep, ah, in the deep there is peace. In the deep, there is wisdom that wells up from within as your self dissolves into the emptiness. This is why we take the youngling mages there, to decant their minds, to clear their thoughts, even if only for that single pilgrimage. But I believe our true salvation lies beneath the city. Somewhere in the shadows is a place that even The Nameless cannot find. One day I will lead them to it, and they too will know peace.;Aeon's End
Xaxos;Breach Mage Adept;4;Metaphysical Link;5;P;;Allies collectively gain 4 charges. Reveal the turn order deck and return the revealed cards in any order.;;0,4,4,3;4,C,C,C,C;C,C,C,C,S;;;;;The others, they do not understand. For them, struggle i a virtue acknowledged by less cruel gods than these. They ignore the dark around them and seek a world whose name they cannot remember. But I have discerned our road to salvation, fractured and perilous, straight through the heart of the void.#We may learn much from these creatures, these divinities, though dark they may be. Theirs is a power to cull wounds, to tear wide the membrane of the universe, to traverse the very emptiness that lay between. Is it not within reason to presume they also have some means to shape worlds as well as destroy them? Perhaps they can whisper into existence more than their fell armies and beasts. The tools they wield are just that - tools. Who is to say we cannot use a tool for a better end?#Yet these words alone are enough to brand a mage heretic. It is for this reason I stifle them, though these thoughts echo behind my silence in a way that seams wisdom. For now, I will study our foes closely, and in doing so I shall learn how to lift us from this torment... no matter what means I must use.;Aeon's End

Z'hana;Breach Mage Renegade;4;Sanctum Glyph;6;M;;Gravehold gains 7 life.;;9,4,3,2;2,C,C,C,C;C,C,C,C,S;;;;;Through the flames I could hear them calling for me. My mother, my father. Their voices drowned in fire and smoke... That was the day I lost my family. That was the day I discovered I was a mage.#My philosophies on The Nameless are even less popular than Xaxos's. Many times I have slept in the crypts for things I have said to others. But many more nights I have fought back the dark, side by side with those who have locked the crypt door behind me.#I have journeyed to the cave mouth many times, sitting in the weak light that somehow manages to penetrate the mountain of rubble that bars our way back to The World That Was. Each time I go, I remove a stone. If they catch me, the crypts await. But I always go back, removing another stone and yet another. One day I will seek whatever awaits me beyond this place. One day I will remove the last stone.;The Depths
